# ClustetingAssignment_102217114

<h4>This proect explores the performance of vaious clustering algorithms by applying them to retail transaction data using different preprocessing techniques. The analysis is conducteed using key-evaluation metrics including Davies-Boulding Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.

Key highlights:
- Multiple clustering algorithms
- Various preprocessing techniques on input features
- Evaluated performance across multiple cluster counts
- Compared results using well-established clustering evaluation metrics
